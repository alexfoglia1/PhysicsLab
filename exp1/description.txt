Aim of this experience is to measure the acceleration of a mass connected to a flywheel.
The flywheel is connected to the mass by means of a pulley and an inextensible iron wire.
The motion is observed under the assumption of uniformly accelerated rectilinear condition.
Measures are taken by the means of three photocells positioned along the vertical axis where
the mass falls. These photocells capture the times when the mass passes in front of them:
	- t0 = 1st photocell time
	- t1 = 2nd photocell time
	- t2 = 3rd photocell time
Once each fotocell height is known:
	- y0 = height of 1st
	- y1 = height of 2st - y0
	- y2 = height of 3rd - y0
The acceleration is given by:

	          y2t1-y1t2
	 a = 2  --------------
                 t1t2(t2-t1)
